# Terraform VPC and EKS Project

#### 👷‍♀️ This Terraform project creates a custom VPC with public and private subnets, an EC2 bastion host with a security group in the public subnet, an EKS cluster with a network interface in the public subnet, and two EKS node groups in the public and private subnets. IAM roles are created for the EKS cluster and node groups, and the necessary policies are attached to them.
